# ASL 2050 Avian Influenza Notebook

This directory contains interim notes and analyses done over the course of
this project. These should R markdown files, and use
**[knitcitations]()** for reference management. Fully developed write-ups may be moved elsewhere.  Both HTML and markdown outputs should be retained in the repository,
so as to keep outputs as the core codebase may change.
